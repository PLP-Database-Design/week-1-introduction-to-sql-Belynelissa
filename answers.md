# 1. Components of a Database Management System(DBMS).
- Software\. Comprises of the intangible parts of a computer and applications\. It manages the database and allows users to interact with it.
- Hardware\. Is the physical infrastructure of a computer.
- Data\. Is the actual processed information stored in the databases.
- Database Access Language\. It allows users to query and manipulate the data stored according to their needs.
- Procedures\. These are the rules that govern how the DBMS is designed and used.


# 2. Relational database
Is a type of database that stores data in a fixed and defined system of tables with pre-defined relationships between the data points.

## Examples of relational database
- MySQL
- PostgreSQL
- Oracle DB
- Maria DB


# 3. Classifications of SQL.
## Data Definition Language(DDL)
Used to define, create, modify and delete database structures. Are essential for setting up dadatbase schema and managing structural components.

## Data Manipulation Language(DML)
Used to manipulate the data within existing database objects. Allow users to reteieve, insert, update and delete data for dynamic interaction with the database.

## Data Control Language(DCL)
Manage access to data within a database. Controls permissions and security levels for users and roles, ensuring that only authorised individuals can perfom specific operations on the data.


# 4. Difference between a primary key and a foreign key.
A primary key uniquely identifies each row in a table while a foreign key links between tables that connect related data.


# 5. An entity relationship diagram.
Is a graphical representation that shows relationships among people, objects, places, or events in a database.

# 6. Advantages of relational databases.
- Data integrity\. Primary keys and foreign keys ensure data is accurate and consistent.
- Improved security\. Increased security and data protection.
- Increased speed and perfomance.
- Easier data entry and maintanance.
- Provides a natural way to represent data and access related data points.
- Improved data access using host and querry languages.

# 7. Types of data types used to store data in tables.

- CHAR\. Fixed length character string.
- Numeric. Storing numbers.
- Boolean. Stores truth or false values.
- Binary. Any data with a binary format.
- VARCHAR. Variable character field with indeterminate length.
- Timestamp. Automatically records the time and date a record was submitted or updated.

# 8. Purpose of Database Management Systems(DBMS).
DBMS helps organisations or individuals store, organise and retrieve large amounts of data efficiently and quickly.
